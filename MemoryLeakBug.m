In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `retain` and `release` in manual memory management.  Consider a scenario where an object is retained multiple times without proper balancing `release` calls. This leads to a situation where the object's retain count never reaches zero, preventing its deallocation even after it's no longer needed. This is a classic memory leak that can slowly consume system resources and eventually lead to crashes.
