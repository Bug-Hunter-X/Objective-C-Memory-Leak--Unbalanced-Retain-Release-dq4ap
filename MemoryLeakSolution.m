The solution involves meticulously tracking the retain and release calls. Every time an object is retained using [object retain], ensure there is a corresponding [object release] when the object is no longer needed.  Better memory management can be achieved using autorelease pools, like this:

@autoreleasepool {
    MyObject *obj = [[MyObject alloc] init];
    // Use obj
    [obj release]; // crucial release call
}

The autorelease pool automatically releases the object at the end of the block. This helps prevent manual memory management errors.
